                <p class="magnifiable">After spending the last ten years working for various social services
                    organizations Nathan Adcock is making a new home in tech. When asked what was the motivation for the
                    change, the San Antonio resident responded, "As much as I loved the work that I was doing before, I
                    have always wanted to develop a skill set that allowed me to problem solve and to create something
                    that people can use". As reported in his resume Nathan attended a four year University, and while
                    his sociology degree has been greatly beneficial, the sequential concrete growth that software
                    development has provided is rewarding in a different </p></div>

                <p>Analyist project an unfettered expansion of Nathan's coding and related skills during the coming months and likely years. The last six months has been a real
                    bear, but has produced stead growth in the Front and and Back end Sectors. Current valuations indicate an exuberant



                    Many investors worry that the stock market’s current overvaluation means that the next bear market—whenever it begins—will be a long and deep one.

                    It might surprise and comfort investors, though, to learn that there is little historical correlation between stock valuations and the length and duration of bear markets.

                    Consider that the longest stock bear market since 1900 began when stocks were far less overvalued than they were at the start of the shortest bear market. I’m referring to the bear markets that began in September 1939 and July 1998, according to a calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research. The former lasted nearly three years while the latter lasted less than two months.

                    At the beginning of that longest bear market, the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio, or CAPE—the one made famous by Yale University finance professor and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller that is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the trailing decade—stood at 16.45. That is below the CAPE ratio’s long-term average, suggesting an undervalued stock market.

                    At the beginning of the shortest bear market, in contrast, the CAPE ratio was more than twice as high, at 38.3. That reading was higher than all prior readings back to 1871, according to data from Prof. Shiller, suggesting a severely overvalued market. And yet the ensuing bear market lasted less than two months.</p>
